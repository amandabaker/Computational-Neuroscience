\paragraph{Results}
When the cultures were treated with TTX (to represent being deprived of visual stimulation)
the number of GABA-positive neurons decrease relative to the control.  However,
when the cultures were treated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
the same quantity of TTX, significantly
fewer GABA-positive neurons died over the course of treatment.  Additionally, K252a,
an endogenous neurotrophin, was added to a solution used to incubate the cultures
for 2 days.  This resulted in a similar decrease in the percentage of GABA-positive
neurons.  While the cells were being treated with TTX, they would not produce spikes.
However, after washing for 30 minutes, the cells would return to spiking and had
an increased firing rate.

\paragraph{Advances}
The paper concludes that because the activity-dependent regulation of circuit excitability
is mediated through the regulation of BDNF, that brain-derived neurotrophic factor
is in control of cortical excitability.

\paragraph{Experimental Design}
The cultures for this experiment were prepared from the visual cortices of 4 to 6
week old rat pups.  The rats were first anesthetized and decapitated, then the brains
were removed and a piece of the visual cortex removed and minced.  The tissue was
processed through multiple chemical solutions before being plated on culture dish
and incubated for 1 to 2 weeks.  The current-clamp recordings measured the potential
across the membrane while injecting current, and the voltage-clamp recordings measured
current while holding the potential difference between the inside and outside of
the cell.  Using these two techniques together allows the author to compare the
results of each to determine whether controlling either current or voltage unexpectedly
impacts the results of the experiment.  Additionally, the experimenters process
the cultures for indirect immunofluorescence against GABA by bathing the cultures
again in multiple solutions, ultimately making the GABA-positive neurons fluoresce.
The experiment could have been improved by testing other brain areas as well so
that the results of the visual cortex could be compared to those of other brain
areas with different compositions.

\paragraph{Weaknesses}
The paper limits experimentation to the visual cortex and fails to compare the composition
of this to that of the rest of the brain. Although the premise of the paper relates
to the reaction of GABA expression with visual exposure to light, it would be interesting
to see if similar effects would be seen elsewhere with exposure to TTX and BDNF.
